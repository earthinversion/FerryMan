# ObservingEarthWithData
This is a repo of IES Coders project at NASA Hackathon 2018 Taipei.
Our web-application introduces different species with their information and images, showing their current distribution and present their "comfort" temperature and rainfall environment. For a more in-depth analysis, we applied the method of Sutherst and Maywald (1985) to estimate the Ecological Index (EI) which reflects how well the species could live in different locations.
