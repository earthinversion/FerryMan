# ObservingEarthWithData
This is a repo of IES Coders project at NASA Hackathon 2018 Taipei.
Our web-application introduces different species with their information and images, showing their current distribution and present their "comfort" temperature and rainfall environment. For a more in-depth analysis, we applied the method of Sutherst and Maywald (1985) to estimate the Ecological Index (EI) which reflects how well the species could live in different locations.

## Motivation
The biological kingdom always amazed us with its diversity and surprise. In a context of fast-changing world of climate and environment, we need to predict and prevent the invasions of some threatening species and find new home for endangered ones. Motivated by this, we used global land surface temperature and precipitation from NASA satellite in combination of different species habitat database to plot the region of comfort for different species. Our ultimate goal is to help those species can go on a ferry and reach their dream homes.

## Details
We hope Ferryman would be a favorite website for all animal lovers and people curious about the biological world. Our website introduces different species with their information and images, showing their current distribution and present their "comfort" temperature and rainfall environment. For a more in-depth analysis, we applied the method of Sutherst and Maywald (1985) to estimate the Ecological Index (EI) which reflects how well the species could live in different locations.
